## Features

- 💯&nbsp;Free and open source.
- 🖥️&nbsp;Uses your own `claude`, `codex`, `opencode` or `pi` login. No API key needed.
- ☁️&nbsp;Easy to set up on a VPS, so your agents keep working when your laptop is closed.
- 📱&nbsp;Fully responsive. Start and review tasks from your phone.
- 🔀&nbsp;Every task gets its own git worktree, so several agents can work at the same time. Extra tasks wait in a queue.
- 🤖&nbsp;Turn on **Autonomous** and a run never stops to ask. It just finishes.
- 📦&nbsp;Turn on **Sandbox** and the task runs in its own [Docker Sandbox](docs/reference.md#sandboxed-runs-docker-sandboxes) microVM that sees only its worktree.
- 📡&nbsp;Watch it work live: agent text, tool calls, tokens and cost.
- 🏁&nbsp;Run the same task ×2 or ×3, compare the diffs and keep the best one.
- 🧩&nbsp;Skills are Markdown files and workflows are short YAML files. Mix agents per step.
- 🐙&nbsp;Run the agent straight on a GitHub issue. Nothing merges on its own.
- 📂&nbsp;One cockpit for all your projects.
- 💾&nbsp;No database. Everything is saved as plain files in `.ai/cezar/`.

## Screenshots

**Parallel tasks** — Run and queue many tasks, each in its own git worktree.

## Quick start

You need **Node 20+** and at least one agent CLI you're logged into:
[Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code), [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex),
[OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) or [pi](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono).
`git` and `gh` are optional.

```bash
cd your-repo
npx cezar-cli
```

This opens the cockpit at `http://localhost:4321`. Type a task, pick a workflow, then hit **Start**.

```bash
npx cezar-cli run "add a --json flag to the export command"   # headless, no browser
npx cezar-cli init                                            # scaffold .ai/cezar/
npx cezar-cli@nightly                                         # try tonight's build
```

> Just want to look around? Run `CEZ_DRY_RUN=1 npx cezar-cli`. It uses a built-in mock agent, so you don't need to log in.

### Run it on a server

```bash
npx cezar-cli server-install --platform ubuntu-vps
```

This sets up HTTPS, a login and a system service, so you can open the cockpit from anywhere, including your phone.
There are guides for [Ubuntu VPS](docs/server-install/ubuntu-vps.md) and [macOS + ngrok](docs/server-install/macosx-ngrok.md).

## How it works

1. **You describe a task.** Type it, attach files, or start from a GitHub issue.
2. **cezar runs a workflow** (agent steps plus shell checks) in a new git worktree, using your agent CLI.
3. **The cockpit streams every step live.** If a check fails, the agent tries again and sees the error.
4. **You check the result.** Read the diff, send notes back, or open a draft PR.

A workflow is a small YAML file in `.ai/cezar/workflows/`:

```yaml
name: fix-and-verify
steps:
  - id: implement
    prompt: "{{task}}"
    skill: project-conventions   # optional: a Markdown skill from .ai/skills
    runner: codex                # optional: which agent runs this step
  - id: verify
    command: "npm test"          # exit 0 = pass
    onFail: { retry: implement, max: 2 }
```

The built-in `quick-task` workflow runs with no setup.
