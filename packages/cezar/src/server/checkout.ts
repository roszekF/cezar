 * The route itself (server.ts) owns the registry write; this module owns the
 * only two things that are genuinely dangerous about cloning on the operator's
 * behalf:
 *
 * 1. **Where the clone lands.** The target is always `<projectsDir>/<name>`
 *    with `name` a single, boring path segment. It is never a nested path,
 *    never `..`, never absolute — the checkout root is a root, not a starting
 *    point for traversal.
 * 2. **What cleanup may delete.** A failed clone must not leave a half-written
 *    directory behind (a later attempt would trip over it, and registering it
 *    would put a broken project in the sidebar). But "rm -rf the target" is a
 *    destructive path reached by a *network failure*, so it is guarded as
 *    tightly as `fs-browse.ts` guards containment — see `cleanupCheckout`.
 *
 * The load-bearing trick for (2) is that the target directory is created HERE,
 * with a non-recursive `mkdir`, before `gh` ever runs. That single syscall is
 * both the atomic existence check (EEXIST ⇒ 409, and we never touched what was
 * there) and the proof of ownership that authorizes cleanup: we only ever
 * delete a directory this operation is known to have created.
