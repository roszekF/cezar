// Nothing in this suite may write to the developer's own `~/.cezar`. Most cases pin
// `CEZ_HOME` themselves, but the pin is one global for the whole worker and their
// `afterEach` deletes it — so a write that outlives its test (a timeout is enough)
// used to resolve the real home and replace the project registry with the fixture's.
//
// This file removes the unpinned state entirely: every worker gets a sandbox home,
// and the pin is restored around every test, so a case that drops it can only leave
// the NEXT write pointed at the sandbox. A test that wants the unpinned default
// deletes the variable inside its own body (see `src/paths.test.ts`) — that still
// works, because this hook runs after the test, not during it. The write guard in
// `assertCezarHomeWriteIsSandboxed` catches whatever still slips through.
// The health payload carries `capabilities.sandbox` only when a real `sbx` is on PATH, so
// without this the suite's health assertions would depend on what the developer happens to
// have installed. Sandbox tests opt back in with their own env (docker-sbx.test.ts).
