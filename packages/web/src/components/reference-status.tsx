/**
 * The one fetcher, mounted once at the app root.
 *
 * Surfaces do not each go and ask. Before this existed they did, and it showed: a six-project
 * sidebar, a task table and an open run header were eight requests on load, several of them about
 * the SAME pull requests — the server's per-number cache absorbed the forge cost, but the round
 * trips were real and the chips lit up in waves as each answered.
 *
 * So a surface REGISTERS what it is painting and the registry unions it. `useReferenceStatuses`
 * still groups by project, so the union comes out as one request per project no matter how many
 * surfaces contributed to it — and a reference two surfaces share is asked about once.
 *
 * A surface with no registry above it (a bare render, a test) keeps fetching for itself, so
 * mounting this is an optimisation and never a requirement.

 * business relaying a value they never read. Threading it as a prop meant touching every one of
 * those intermediate components on every surface — for a value that is, by design, optional
 * everywhere.
 *
 * Mounting is also what makes it opt-in. A surface that does not mount the provider — a test
 * rendering a table with no query client, a preview, an embedded row — gets `undefined` for
 * every chip, which is exactly the neutral chip the cockpit painted before statuses existed.
