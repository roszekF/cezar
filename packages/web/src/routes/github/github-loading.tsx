/**
 * The GitHub tab's loading state, in its own module ON PURPOSE (same rule as ThreadLoading):
 * it is both the route's fetch-pending state and the `Suspense` fallback for the lazily-loaded
 * github chunk (routes.tsx) — and the fallback must not import anything from that chunk, or
 * the split that keeps the markdown stack off the main bundle quietly disappears.
 *
 * `forgeKind` is optional (Step 3.8-review-fix): the Suspense-fallback call sites in routes.tsx
 * render before `useHealth()` has ever resolved, so they mount this with no kind at all — which,
 * like everywhere else in the tab, reads as GitHub. Only the route's own fetch-pending render
 * (`github.tsx`, which already has `health.data?.forge?.kind`) passes one in.
